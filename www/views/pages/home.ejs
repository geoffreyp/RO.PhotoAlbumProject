        his web application is developed in order to improve user utilisation to create a photo album with some optimisation algorithms.
        Just above, please check the list of different features which can be used on this web application.

    <h4 class="title-decoration">Features and terms used</h4>
    <div class="container-text">
        Some important definitions :
        <ul>
            <li><u>Template :</u> It is a term used to define an album composed with user photo. A template can be used to generate some album photo after making generation.</li>
            <li><u>Album type :</u> Define a kind of photo disposition of an album. This property is used to generate album when associated with the template.</li>
            <li><u>Album :</u> It's a final "solution", to make sense, that's a final proposition of an album generation. After generating solutions and select one of its, the user can make last updates to improve its album.</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="container-text">
        One of the ambition of the project is to make it an independent application. Then, with some IA algorithms learned later in courses, the objective is to use user updates to improve the quality of future generations.
